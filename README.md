Structural Health Monitoring

🏗️ Structural Health Monitoring System – Python Simulation
📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system using Python. It mimics how sensors installed on key parts of a structure (e.g., beams and columns) collect data on vibrations, strain, and temperature to detect potential structural issues.

The primary goal is to demonstrate how real-time monitoring can help in early detection of stress or damage, thereby enhancing safety and reliability in buildings, bridges, and other civil infrastructure.

⚙️ Key Features
Simulates sensors at different structural locations (e.g., Beam 1, Column B).

Randomly generates realistic sensor data:

Acceleration (0–10 m/s²)
Strain (1000–3000 microstrain)
Temperature (20–80 °C)
Compares each reading against predefined safety thresholds.

Issues alerts if readings exceed thresholds (e.g., excessive vibration or overheating).

Performs the simulation over multiple monitoring cycles.

Uses time.sleep() to simulate real-time data acquisition.

🧠 Use Cases
Ideal for educational purposes, prototyping, or explaining SHM principles.
Can be expanded to support real sensor input, GUI dashboards, or cloud storage.
Provides a foundation for developing real-world IoT or civil engineering monitoring systems.
🔧 Future Enhancements (Optional Ideas)
Real-time plotting of sensor data.
Data logging to a file or database.
Email or SMS alerts.
Basic anomaly detection using AI.
Interactive GUI dashboard with live status indicators.

The AI-Powered Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) System is designed to enhance 
infrastructure safety by using advanced AI algorithms, sensor networks, and IoT technology 
to monitor and assess the structural integrity of buildings and bridges in real-time. The 
system continuously collects data such as strain, vibration, temperature, and displacement, 
analyzing it with machine learning models to detect anomalies and potential failures. This 
report documents the final project phase, including system demonstration, technical 
documentation, performance evaluation, source code overview, and testing outcomes. 
Visual documentation, including architecture diagrams and code snapshots, are also 
provided to showcase the system’s architecture and functionality.
